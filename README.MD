# Custumers Orders

Once the costumer has checked out we have to register the order in the database 

We have created 2 Models, one for costumer information and a second one for the order items
### ModelInline

We have created 2 models one for the costumer information and a second one for items orders, we have then used the ModelInline class for the items order model in order to include it as an inline form inside the Orders admin form.

## Form
Once the Models have been created is now time to create the checkout form
